### Problem 1: Classification of Data

Drinking water, also known as potable water, is water that is safe to drink or use for food preparation. The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental
conditions. For those who work in a hot climate, up to 16 liters a day may be required.
Typically, in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even
though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other
typical uses include washing, toilets, and irrigation.
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component
of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development
issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that
investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the
reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of
undertaking the interventions.
